   <br>
   `function sayHi(name) {
  return Hi there, ${name};

   <br>
   B: Hi there, undefined
   <br>
   C: Hi there, null
   <br>
   D: ReferenceError

Answer : B ;
Explanation :
In the code, the sayHi function expects a 'name' parameter. but when we call sayHi() without providing any argument, the 'name' variable inside the function doesn't have a value assigned to it. So, when we call sayHi() without an argument, the function returns "Hi there, undefined"

5. Write the correct answer from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).
<br>
   `let count = 0;
const nums = [0, 1, 2, 3];
nums.forEach((num) => {
if (num) count += 1;
});
console.log(count);`
<br/>
<br>
A: 1
<br>
B: 2
<br>
C: 3
<br>
D: 4

Answer : C ;
Explanation :
In this code, a variable count is initialized to 0, and there is an array nums containing the values [0, 1, 2, 3]. The forEach array method is used to iterate over each items of the array. Inside the callback function, it checks whether the num is there or not as a value.which is truthy For values 1, 2, and 3, the condition is true, and count is incremented by 1 each time. Therefore, after through all items in the array index, the latest items in index result value 3
